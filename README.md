# VSCode Todoist

Track and sync your development todos with [Todoist](https://todoist.com), right in VSCode!

## Features & Usage

Each command has a global user, workspace, and parameterized version. Both the global user and workspace commands will use the Todoist project set in your `todoist.projectId` setting; if this is not set, then you will be prompted to choose or create a Todoist project. Parameterized commands, on the other hand, take the Todoist project as a parameter. Note that parameterized commands do not have a default keybinding, and instead require you to configure your own keybindings for them.

This VSCode extension adds several commands to the command palette:

### Todoist Capture [Workspace]

Default Keybinding <kbd>alt+t c</kbd>.

Pop open an input box to capture a todo for your current project. If you have a text selection made when this is invoked, it will pre-populate the input field with a link to your current file and line number, for easy deep linking from the Todoist desktop app.

### Todoist Todos [Workspace]

Default Keybinding <kbd>alt+t t</kbd>.

Shows all the incomplete todos in your current Todoist project. Selecting an item will toggle its completeness. Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to dismiss the list.

### Todoist Open [Workspace]

Default Keybinding <kbd>alt+t o</kbd>.

If you have the Todoist desktop app installed, this will open or switch to the Todoist app and select your current project.

### Todoist Capture [Global]

Default Keybinding <kbd>alt+t C</kbd>.

Pop open an input box to capture a todo for your global user project. If you have a text selection made when this is invoked, it will pre-populate the input field with a link to your current file and line number, for easy deep linking from the Todoist desktop app.

### Todoist Todos [Global]

Default Keybinding <kbd>alt+t T</kbd>.

Shows all the incomplete todos in for your global user project. Selecting an item will toggle its completeness. Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to dismiss the list.

### Todoist Open [Global]

Default Keybinding <kbd>alt+t O</kbd>.

If you have the Todoist desktop app installed, this will open or switch to the Todoist app and select your global user project.

### Todoist Capture [Id]

No default keybinding.

Pop open an input box to capture a todo for the chosen Todoist project. If you have a text selection made when this is invoked, it will pre-populate the input field with a link to your current file and line number, for easy deep linking from the Todoist desktop app.

### Todoist Todos [Id]

No default keybinding.

Shows all the incomplete todos in the chosen Todoist project. Selecting an item will toggle its completeness. Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to dismiss the list.

### Todoist Open [Id]

If you have the Todoist desktop app installed, this will open or switch to the Todoist app and select your chosen project.

## Requirements & Installation

Obviously this requires a [Todoist](https://todoist.com) account. To use "Todoist Open" and take advantage of the deep linking feature, you will also need the Todoist desktop app.

To install this extension, open the command palette and enter:

```
ext install waymondo.todoist
```

Finally, set the `todoist.apiToken` setting to your Todoist API token which can be found [here](https://todoist.com/prefs/integrations).

You may set `todoist.projectId` in your user and workspaces settings manually or with the commands above.

## Project Goals & Motivation

* Create a simple and lightweight method of capturing and organizing tasks on a per-project basis.

* Leverage a well-featured todo app service instead of re-invent the wheel.

* Todoist is a good candidate for such a service, since you can easily stay in touch with your todos on the go with their mobile apps.

* Implement a way where the basic features can be used strictly from within VSCode.

## Known Issues

I have not yet tested on any platforms other than macOS. Ideas for improvement and patches are welcome!
